# Hi there, I'm Patrick 👋

Design Director & Technical Leader building the future of design systems at **[Avail](https://avail.co)**

## What I Do

I bridge the gap between design and engineering, leading cross-functional teams to build scalable design systems that power consistent user experiences. Currently heading product design at Avail while architecting our in-house design system with a team of engineers and designers.

### 🎯 Current Focus
- **Design Systems Leadership**: Building tools and processes for consistent software at scale
- **Cross-Platform Strategy**: Contributing to roadmapping discussions with realtor.com's design system
- **Team Growth**: Mentoring designers and engineers in systematic thinking

### 🛠️ Tech Stack

  languages: ['TypeScript', 'Ruby', 'JavaScript'],
  frameworks: ['React', 'Next.js', 'Rails'],
  design: ['Figma', 'Design Tokens', 'Component APIs'],
  architecture: ['Enterprise Rails', 'Design Systems', 'Monorepos']
}
```

## Open Source & Side Projects

## Philosophy

I believe the best design systems emerge from the intersection of:
- **Technical Excellence** — Clean, performant, accessible code
- **Design Thinking** — User-centered component APIs and documentation
- **Team Collaboration** — Building bridges between design and engineering cultures
